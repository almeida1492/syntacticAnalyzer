# syntacticAnalyzer
This repository contains a syntactic analyzer for the PLM language. It is written in the programming language C and it is part of the course Compilers of the University of the Northern Rio de Janeiro - UENF.
This program consumes a queue with the tokens generated in the lexical analysis step. With this queue, it is possible to build up a logical tree in order to verify the correctness of the source code being analyzed.
